In addition, there are 3 other cycles. 2 cycles of 16, and a cycle of 8 that is disconnected from the rest of the graph. The component at the top is all the numbers that go to 0, which is stable by itself. While not immediately present, the mirrored aspect of the graph is due to many components being identical but bit rotated by 1.

While no stable byte arrays made of one repeated byte exist, there may be stable byte arrays made of mixed bytes.`;
